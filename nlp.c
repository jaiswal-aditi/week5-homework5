/*
  Write a C program that processes a sentence character by character using a function pipeline.

  You must:
  - remove stopwords
  - count the words in the processed sentence
  - count vowels, uppercase and lowercase letters
  - make sure the function calls are correct

  ** To deal with string values and functions (when checking for stopwords), use string.h header file
